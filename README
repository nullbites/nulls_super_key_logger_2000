The zip is the unmolested version taken from source forge

But that's no fun. 

I've alse added some silencing statements to klogger.c
Up top there should be a:

#define LOUD 0;

statment. If you set this to "1" it will print debug info to
the syslog

TODO:
1) configuration file:
The config'll write all the var names to what they need to be across 
all the scripts.

2) generate a rc.S script for loading 
3) make a systemd module
4) automatically (make install) install the .ko in /kernel/drivers/ and depmod


Email me with questions!
