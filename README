The zip is the unmolested version.

But that's no fun. 

The install script has never been run. I wrote it up as 
border-line pseudo-code for if we try and do this thing correctly.
It should be fairly un-intuitive though.
Also, I'm going to work on geetting everything varaible-ized
So it can be modified on the fly quickly (like the install dir
and w/e)

I've alse added some silencing statements to the klogger.c
file itself. Up top there should be a:

#define LOUD 0;

statment. If you set this to "1" it will print debug info to
the syslog

This might be a good time to write a configuration file:
The config'll write all the var names to what they need to be across 
all the scripts.

I'm rambling.

Email me with questions if you need help understanding something.
